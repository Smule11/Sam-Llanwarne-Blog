Welcome to my blog...

<ins>Why?</ins>

* to practice public writing
* to practice science communication
* to summarise technical work I did
* to summarise How To's such as this, where I do something once, which is not trivial, and I want to record how to do it, for other people and for future reference.
* for my CV
* as a record of papers I've read
* as a log of my thoughts
* to inspire others to do the same and to create some sort of small, shallow community online of well intentioned people.

I also wish to be able to make the blog with minimal effort, while still having a feature rich blog suitable to machine learning coding.

This will become the first entry into my blog online. Each entry will be a .ipynb notebook file embedded into this Quarto HTML template.
